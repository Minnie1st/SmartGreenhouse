## Owner: Erik
## Location: Tartu County, Estonia

Erik is a software developer living in a quiet rural area just outside Tartu. Passionate about sustainable living, he built a small automated greenhouse behind his house to grow tomatoes. His job requires him to work in an office in Tartu city during weekdays, so he relies on a smart system to manage his crops while he’s away.

It's a warm Wednesday morning. Erik leaves home at 8:00 AM and heads to work. Around 10:20 AM, he receives a notification on his phone:

“Greenhouse Temperature: 33°C – Ventilation Activated”
“Soil Moisture Low in Zone B (Tomato Bed) – Suggest Irrigation”

He opens his SmartGrow app and reviews the live dashboard:

Temperature: 33°C

Humidity: 44%

Soil Moisture (Zone B): 18%

Vent Status: Open

Motion Sensor: No movement

He taps the “Irrigate Zone B” button, which triggers the solar-powered water pump to deliver a controlled 25-second watering to the tomato rows. A real-time image from the camera confirms the process completed successfully.

At noon, the system detects strong sunlight and automatically extends a shade cloth using a servo motor to protect the young tomato plants from direct heat.

Later, at 3:45 PM, a bird flutters close to the greenhouse and triggers the ultrasonic motion sensor. A gentle sound is emitted and the small animal flies away — the system logs the activity but requires no further action.

When Erik returns home at 6:30 PM, he walks past the greenhouse and checks the LED status panel:

Ventilation: Normal

Moisture: Normal

Temperature: Normal

Motion: No alerts

System Health: OK

He enters the greenhouse and sees that the tomatoes are well-hydrated and thriving. Without needing to intervene during his busy workday, everything was taken care of automatically.
