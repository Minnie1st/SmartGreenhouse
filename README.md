# Smart Geenhouse
## This is the **final project** for the **Internet of Things (IoT)** course at **University of Tartu**, Spring 2025.

## Overview

This project addresses the need for smarter, low-maintenance greenhouse management in outdoor environments. It helps monitor plant health, automate watering, and detect nearby movement â€” making the system more resilient to both environmental changes and unexpected outdoor interference.

## Using IoT technology, we created a system that:

- Detects nearby birds and warns them
- Triggers a buzzer as a warning
- Automatically waters plants based on soil moisture
- Monitors temperature and humidity
- Low-cost and solar-powered design
  
## Tech Stack
- ESP8266
- Soil moisture sensor
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- Water pump + relay module
- LED + buzzer 
- Node-RED dashboard
- MQTT protocol
- Solar panel
